# Contributing to Genie Web Client

We welcome contributions to the genie-web-client! Please adhere to the following guidelines.

## General guidelines

 - **Create an issue**: Before starting any significant work, check for an existing issue or create a new one to discuss the proposed change or feature.
 - **Branching**: Always create a new branch from `main` (or the current feature branch) for your work. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/add-new-dashboard` or `fix/i18n-bug`).
 - **Commit messages**: Use clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat: implement new widget component`).
 - **Testing**: Ensure all new features have appropriate tests and that all existing tests pass.
 - **Linting**: Run `yarn run lint` before committing to ensure code quality and style standards are met.
 - **Create a pull request**:
   - Target the `main` branch.
   - Clearly describe the changes, including why the change is necessary and any potential side effects. Link the relevant issue(s).
 - **Review**: All PRs require at least one approval from a teammate before merging.
